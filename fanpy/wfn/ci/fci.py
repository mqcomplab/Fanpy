class FCI(CIWavefunction):
    r"""Full Configuration Interaction Wavefunction.

    Given :math:`2K` spin orbitals (or :math:`K` spatial orbitals) and :math:`N` electrons, there
    are a total of :math:`\binom{2K}{N}` different Slater determinants. While many of these are
    equivalent via certain symmetry operations (e.g. flipping the spin) under some conditions (e.g.
    alpha and beta orbitals are the same), no such considerations are taken in the class.

        \left| \Psi_{\mathrm{FCI}} \right> =
        \sum_{\mathbf{m} \in S_{\mathrm{FCI}}} c_{\mathbf{m}} \left| \mathbf{m} \right>
