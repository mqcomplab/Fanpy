        r"""Return the overlap of the nonlinear wavefunction with a Slater determinant.

        The overlap of the nonlinear  wavefunction with a Slater determinant is the product of tanh of the parameters corresponding to the occupied orbitals of that
        Slater determinant in the wavefunction.

        .. math::

            \left< m \middle| \Psi \right> = \prod_i tanh(p_i)

        where

        .. math::

            \left| \Psi \right> = \sum_m (\prod_i tanh(p_i_m)) \left| m \right>
            \left| m \right> = \left \phi_1 \phi_2 ... \phi_N \right>

            Here, each orbital \phi_i of a Slater determinant |m> has one parameter p_i.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sd : int
            Slater Determinant against which the overlap is taken.
        deriv : {np.ndarray, None}
            Indices of the parameters with respect to which the overlap is derivatized.
            Default returns the overlap without derivatization.

        Returns
        -------
        overlap : {float, np.ndarray}
            Overlap (or derivative of the overlap) of the wavefunction with the given Slater
            determinant.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If Slater determinant is not an integer.
