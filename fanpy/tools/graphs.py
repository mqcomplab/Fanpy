    Generated perfect matches correspond to a pairing scheme in geminal wavefunctions and the

# TODO: add sign for reordering the partitions back into original ordering?
def generate_unordered_partition(collection, bin_size_num):
    """Generate unordered partitions of the given collection into subsets of the given sizes.

    We can think of the partition as distributing the given elements into bins. Each bin has a fixed
    size and is full at the end of the distribution. In an unordered partition, the bins of the same
    size are not distinguishable. Additionally, there is no ordering within each bin.

    In order to avoid repeating the same partitions, we follow some conventions such that the
    repeated partitions resulting from reordering are not possible.

        1. Elements within a bin are ordered. For example, bin `[1, 2, 3]` has ordered elements
           where as `[1, 3, 2]` does not.
        2. First elements of bins of equal sizes are ordered. For example, the bins `[1, 4]` and
           `[2, 3]` are ordered if `[[1, 4], [2, 3]]` but are unordered if `[[2, 4], [1, 4]]`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    collection : list
        List of elements that will be partitioned.
        This should be an ordered list to ensure a correct number of partitions and correct ordering of the bins. 
    bin_size_num : list of 2-tuple of int
        List of tuples that describe the size and the number of the bins.
        First element of the tuple is the size of the bin.
        Second element of the tuple is the number of bins of the given size.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> unordered_partition([1, 2, 3], [(2, 1), (1, 1)])
    [[[1, 2], [3]], [[1, 3], [2]], [[2, 3], [1]]]
