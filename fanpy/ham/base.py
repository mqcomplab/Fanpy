            Slater Determinant against which the Hamiltonian is integrated.
        wfn : Wavefunction
            Wavefunction against which the Hamiltonian is integrated.
            Needs to have the following in `__dict__`: `get_overlap`.
        wfn_deriv : np.ndarray

            Option for separating the integrals into the one electron, coulomb, and exchange
            components.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If Slater determinant is not an integer.
